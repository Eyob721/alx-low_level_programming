# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

## \_putchar.c

For this project students are allowed to use only \_putchar.c function to complete the tasks. Using the standard library is not allowed, unless mentioned otherwise.

## Mandatory

-   0-putchar.c
    -   a program that prints the string "\_putchar" followed by a new line.
-   1-alphabet.c
    -   a function that prints lowercase alphabets, followed by a new line, using only \_putchar twice.
-   2-print_alphabet_x10.c
    -   a function that prints lowercase alphabets, followed by a new line, x10 times.
    -   \_putchar can only be used twice
-   3-islower.c
    -   a function that checks for lowercase character.
-   4-isalpha.c
    -   a function that checks for alphabetic character.
-   5-sign.c
    -   a function that prints the sign of a number.
    -   returns 1 (if the number is greater than 0)
    -   returns 0 (if the number is equal to 0)
    -   returns -1 (if the number is less than 0)
-   6-abs.c
    -   a function that computes and returns the absolute value of an integer.
-   7-print_last_digit
    -   a function that prints and returns the last digit of an integer.
-   8-24_hours.c
    -   a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
-   9-times_table.c
    -   a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
-   10-add.c
    -   a functions that adds two integers and returns the result.
-   11-print_to_98.c
    -   a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98.
    -   it is allowed to use standard library.

## Advanced

-   100-times_table.c
    -   a function that prints the n times table, starting from 0.
    -   n is an integer passed to the function.
    -   if n is greater than 15 or less than 0, it prints nothing.
-   101-natural.c
    -   a program that computes the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded).
-   102-fibonacci.c
    -   a program that prints the first 50 fibonacci numbers starting from 1 and 2.
-   103-fibonacci.c
    -   a program that prints the sum of the even numbers in the fibonacci sequence which are under 4,000,000.
-   104-fibonacci.c - a program that prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
